It's some Screeps stuff, don't fret.

Includes config for Atom Ternjs. Uses Flow.
Autocomplete is provided by a symlink to ..\\ScreepsAutocomplete.
Transpiled files in .build/ and node_modules/ are ignored via .git/info/exclude.

npm install to get started.
npm start to transpile on change from Flow to vanilla JS (src/ to build/)
(for now, kill process to get out. Wth is async again?)
